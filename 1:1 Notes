1:1

* 1 way mapping - no extra annotation

@Entity
public class Team extends BaseModel{
    private String teamName;
    @OneToOne
    private TeamDetails teamDetails;
}

@Entity
public class TeamDetails extends BaseModel{
    private String teamDetails;

}

output -> Team and TeamDetails table got created.Team table has Foreign Key called team_details .
Non Desired Output

* 2 way mapping - no extra annotation

@Entity
public class Team extends BaseModel{
    private String teamName;
    @OneToOne
    private TeamDetails teamDetails;
}

@Entity
public class TeamDetails extends BaseModel{
    private String teamDetails;
    @OneToOne
        private Team team;

}
output -> Team and TeamDetails table got created . Team table had Foreign Key called team_details
and TeamDetails table had Foreign Key called team_id.

Non Desired output.

* 1 way mapping - no extra annotation

@Entity
public class Team extends BaseModel{
    private String teamName;

}

@Entity
public class TeamDetails extends BaseModel{
    private String teamDetails;
    @OneToOne
    private Team team;
}

output -> Team and TeamDetails table got created . In team table there is no Foreign Key and in
TeamDetails table team_id is present as Foreign key .

Desired Output for 1:1 , one way mapping with no extra annotation.

* 2 way mapping with - mappedBy and JoinColumn annotation

@Entity
public class Team extends BaseModel{
    private String teamName;
    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "team")
    private TeamDetails teamDetails;
}

***** Note
1.mappedBy is put on the attribute that is owned by other attribute in 2 way mapping.
Here teamDetails is being owned by team so we put mapped by on top of teamDetails in Team class.

2. IN the TeamDetails class the attribute which we want as foreign key we put @JoinColumn at top
of that attribute i.e team_id is the foreign key present in the teamDetails table.


@Entity
public class TeamDetails extends BaseModel{
    private String teamDetails;
    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="team_id")
    private Team team;
}

output -> Team and TeamDetails table got created . In team table there is no Foreign Key and in
TeamDetails table team_id is present as Foreign key .

Desired Output for 1:1 , 2 way mapping with mappedBy and JoinColumn annotation .
